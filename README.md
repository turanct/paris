Paris: simple parsing tools
=======================================

[![Travis CI](https://api.travis-ci.org/turanct/paris.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/turanct/paris)

Paris is a library of simple tools to parse any given input string. Paris is a written as a learning project, it is not meant to be used in production.


Goals
---------------------------------------

- Provide simple tools to parse a string to something a computer can understand
- Create complex parsers from simple building blocks
- Memory efficiency, speed, etc. are **not** the goal of this project.


Credits
---------------------------------------

Some of the thoughts behind this are stolen from [Parsec](https://wiki.haskell.org/Parsec), which is a Haskell parser library. It's actually 100000 times nicer than this one, so check it out.
